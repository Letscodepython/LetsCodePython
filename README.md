Letâ€™s Code Python is an initiative geared towards teaching programming fundamentals to an audience that would normally not have access to such knowledge. One of the major driving forces is the shift happening within the technological space and industry worldwide.
To prepare for the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) programming has become more than a special skill but rather a fundamental core skill one needs to be able to position themselves accordingly within the 4IR.

A quick disclaimer this is not a credited python course but rather a fundamentals course to teach programming fundamentals using python because it is the easiest language to learn. By completing the course no certification will be given only a course completion certificate.
